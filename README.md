# Zed Crystal Support (WIP)

![](./assets/image.png)

This is very much a work in progress as the tree-sitter is developed. Utilizes the tree-sitter found [here](https://github.com/crystal-lang-tools/tree-sitter).

Dev installation:
- Clone the repository, rename the folder to `crystal`
- Install [crystalline](https://github.com/elbywan/crystalline/releases/tag/v0.14.1) and make sure it is on `$PATH`
- In Zed, install a dev extension with Cmd+Shift+P > `install dev extension`
